# ✈️ Combat Aircraft Automation using Behavior Trees

This project demonstrates an automation system for combat aircraft using **Behavior Trees**, developed for research and prototyping under DRDO guidance.

---

##  Objective

To simulate and evaluate autonomous decision-making for unmanned combat aircraft using modular, extensible behavior trees — improving mission efficiency, survivability, and adaptive tactics.

---

##  Key Features

- 🧠 Modular behavior tree engine  
- 🌐 Web-based UI (Flask)  
- ⚙️ Dynamic mission simulations  
- ✅ Easily extendable tree nodes  
- 🔄 Real-time feedback and visual state tracking
