# ✈️ Combat Aircraft Automation using Behavior Trees

This project demonstrates an automation system for combat aircraft using **Behavior Trees**, developed for research and prototyping under DRDO guidance.

---

##  Objective

To simulate and evaluate autonomous decision-making for unmanned combat aircraft using modular, extensible behavior trees — improving mission efficiency, survivability, and adaptive tactics.

---

##  Key Features

-  Modular behavior tree engine  
-  Web-based UI (Flask)  
-  Dynamic mission simulations  
-  Easily extendable tree nodes  
-  Real-time feedback and visual state tracking

---

##  Project Structure
-  app.py                      # Main Flask app

-   behavior_trees/            # Core behavior tree logic

-   templates/                 # Web interface templates

-   static/                    # CSS/JS and visualization assets
